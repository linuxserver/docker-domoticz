    ### Passing Through USB Devices

    To get full use of Domoticz, you probably have a USB device you want to pass through. To figure out which device to pass through, you have to connect the device and look in dmesg for the device node created. Issue the command 'dmesg | tail' after you connected your device and you should see something like below.

    ```
    usb 1-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 7 using ehci-pci
    ftdi_sio 1-1.2:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
    usb 1-1.2: Detected FT232RL
    usb 1-1.2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
    ```
    As you can see above, the device node created is ttyUSB0. It does not say where, but it's almost always in /dev/. The correct tag for passing through this USB device is '--device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0'
